By submitting your application, you agree to the following:

1. **Imaginary Flight**  
   The IISA is entirely fictional. Submitting this form will not launch you into space (yet).

2. **Cosmic Records**  
   Your details may be stored in the IISA archives, which technically exist only in our imagination.

3. **No Guarantees**  
   Spacesuits, rockets, or astronaut snacks are not included. Please bring your own enthusiasm.

4. **Alien Encounters**  
   In the event of first contact, the IISA reserves the right to claim you as our official representative.

5. **Fun-Only Clause**  
   This whole thing is just for fun. If you take it too seriously, Mission Control may revoke your coffee privileges.
